  Summary:
		WiFiDB is a PHP and MySQL based set of scripts that is intended to manage 
		Wireless Access points found with the Vistumber Wireless scanning software  
		
  Installation:
		NOTE: If you are using Linux, you must chown & chgrp the wifidb folder, to the user 
		that you have apache or what ever HTTP server you are using (This is so that 
		the installer can create the config file, and to generate the graph images 
		and export KML files)
		
		Go to /[WiFiDB Path]/install/ 
		Or [WiFiDB Path]/upgrade/
		If you are upgrading
		and follow the steps, please read the notes beforehand at /[WiFiDB Path]/install/notes.html or /[WiFiDB Path]/upgrade/notes.php.
		The reset.sql file is a database reset script, mostly for advanced users, it basically drops all the DB's and re-creates them - use at your own risk
